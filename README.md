# Slack endpoint

## Overview
The Slack endpoint supports the following features:

- Shortcuts for web API
- Real time API
- Interactive messages
- Slash commands
- Events API
- Conversations

In most cases data formats and methods available are the same you can find in the 
[Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com), so we strongly suggest to read it
and understand how it works.
